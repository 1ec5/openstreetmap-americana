# Code of Conduct

The OpenStreetMap Americana project has opted in (#489) to the [OpenStreetMap US Code of Conduct](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Foundation/Local_Chapters/United_States/Code_of_Conduct_Committee/OSM_US_Code_of_Conduct) (CoC) and [Process for Moderation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Foundation/Local_Chapters/United_States/Code_of_Conduct_Committee/ModerationProcess).

This document outlines the standards for behavior in this project, and describes the procedure that users may follow if they experience unacceptable behavior.

## Encouraged Behaviors
* **Be welcoming**. OpenStreetMap US strives to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. Some examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:
    * The use of welcoming and inclusive language;
    * Respect for differing viewpoints and experiences;
    * Empathy towards other community members.
* **Be considerate and patient**. Actively seek to acknowledge, respect, and understand fellow community members. Our community depends on the work of each other to maintain and strengthen the health and integrity of OpenStreetMap. Any decision you make may affect others, and those consequences should be taken into account. While critique is a natural and important part of our culture, good critiques are kind, respectful, clear, and constructive.
* **Assume good faith**. It is surprisingly easy to misunderstand each other, be it online or in person; particularly in such a culturally and linguistically diverse setting as OpenStreetMap US. Misunderstandings can easily arise when we are in a rush, or otherwise distracted. Please ask clarifying questions before assuming that a communication was inappropriate.
* **Be respectful**. Enthusiastic discussions are part of the lifeblood of a successful project but can also lead to disagreements. We should strive to keep our discussions and disagreements appropriate. Members of the OpenStreetMap US community should be respectful when dealing with others, within and outside of the global OpenStreetMap community. We note, however, that non-OpenStreetMap US spaces are not part of this Code of Conduct.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen easily and often. It is important that we seek to understand each other and work to resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. When someone contradicts your own perceptions, try to understand where the other person is coming from. Try to ask questions that will serve to clarify, rather than to escalate, an issue.

## Untolerated Behaviors

Examples of untolerated behaviors include, but are not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person, including deliberate intimidation or harassment (online or in-person);
* Verbal, written, or physical abuse;
* Discrimination of any person or group of persons;
* Discriminatory jokes and language;
* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature;
* The use of unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms;
* Disrespect towards others (ex. personal insults, innuendo);
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material, or including this content in events such as conference presentations, talks, workshops, or parties;
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing");
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop. This includes:
    * Continued unwelcomed one-on-one communication after a request to cease
    * Unwelcome sexual attention
    * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* Sustained disruptions of community events and discussions;
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Process for Moderation

We encourage users to [work out issues directly](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Foundation/Local_Chapters/United_States/Code_of_Conduct_Committee/OSM_US_Code_of_Conduct#How_to_Handle_a_Complaint) with the people involved in lieu of a formal report.
If you believe someone has violated the CoC, we ask that you report it to OpenStreetMap US Code of Conduct Committee via the process outlined in the [Process for Moderation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Foundation/Local_Chapters/United_States/Code_of_Conduct_Committee/ModerationProcess). The CoC Committee will adjudicate reports submitted via this process, however, they will not actively monitor project communication channels.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

* The maintainer team agrees to abide by the CoC and to implement and be bound by moderation decisions made by the CoC Committee. This includes making a best effort to resolve disputes
* Maintainers agree not to act in CoC cases in which a maintainer has a conflict of interest, such as in the case of a complaint made against the maintainer.

## Applicability

* This CoC applies to the OpenStreetMap Americana github repository. however, the CoC committee may consider a holistic examination of  communications made via other channels when evaluating a complaint.
* This CoC remains in force until or unless revoked by the maintainer team, the OSM US CoC Committee, or OSM US.  Should the CoC be revoked, it remains applicable for all behavior which occurred prior to revocation.
* The list of encouraged and untolerated behaviors are adopted as written at the time of the approval of this CoC. Should the standards of behavior in the OSM US CoC change, the maintainer team reserves the right to adopt the change, withdraw from the Process for Moderation, or neither.
* The OSM US CoC Committee may at any time change the procedures outlined in the Process for Moderation and/or the Statement of Scope and Limitations as documented in the Committee's [online documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Foundation/Local_Chapters/United_States/Code_of_Conduct_Committee/OSM_US_Code_of_Conduct). The project adopts these procedures as currently written, even if they differ from the procedures that were in force at the time of the project's adoption of the CoC.
* If the locations of the official online documentation of the OSM US CoC and Process for Moderation change, the presently applicable documentation applies, and updates to these links may be made as an administrative change.
